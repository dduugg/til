# Motivation
I was reading through Ruby Performance optimization and needed access to Valgrind.
Valgrind was unavailable on Catalina and I wanted to try an alternative to the local VM route.

The following is adapted from https://makandracards.com/makandra/28149-installing-rbenv-on-ubuntu
We need make and a C compiler, in addition to the requirements in the link above.
```
sudo apt-get update
# need make & a compiler
sudo apt install gcc make autoconf bison build-essential libssl-dev libyaml-dev libreadline6-dev zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev
# optional
sudo apt install valgrind
git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build
rbenv install 2.7.0
rbenv global 2.7.0
# also optional
wget http://media.pragprog.com/titles/adrpo/code/adrpo-code.tgz
tar xf adrpo-code.tgz
```
